# GERTY

So this is GERTY. it's basically a recreation of the robot from the movie 'Moon' that me and some friends are building.

honestly we're just trying to make something that looks like the actual thing and doesn't fall apart. 
the design files are in the design folder if you want to see what this mess looks like. they're 3vs files so you'll need whatever software opens those (techsoft). we're trying to fit a raspberry pi and camera in there somewhere too.

check the journal if you want to see us struggle with proportions and scaling. spoiler alert: we had to redesign everything because we can't measure consistently.

that's it. it's not rocket science.
