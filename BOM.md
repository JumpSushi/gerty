## why buying parts seperately 

honestly the main reason i'm not doing PCB assembly is money lol. JLCPCB charges so much for assembly - like they have the placement fee, then extended component fees for anything thats not in their basic library. its ridiculous how much it adds up.

most of this stuff i can get way cheaper on taobao anyway. the ws2812b strips, that camera module - JLCPCB would probably charge double for those as "extended components". (I really don't have the proper experience in desiging PCBs to design these, anayways)

yeah... it means more work soldering everything together, however for just one unit the savings are decent, probably looking at like $150+ through JLCPCB vs the $70 doing it myself, however JLCPCB does give you 5 PCBs.
