Today I began designing the main body for the robot. It is painful. I have a reference image, but the proportions are odd, and we need to work out how the Pi and camera are going to fit in before I finish those holes. The sizing for the camera module took me a good few minutes, but I think it works. I had the image up on my iPad so I could see it better.

Today i started working on the bottom bit of the robot, this is the area underneath the main body, which generic villan is working on. After double checking the design about 20 minutes later, i realized some of the pieces were not the correct sizing as the part is meant to go inwards, and the panel meant to go above it had only been designed to the height instead of the length of the surface.

I needed to re-do some of the sizing on pieces meant to be put onto diagonal surfaces since they were to short and would just leave open areas at the top or bottom. When designing the bottom area, me and generic villain (the 2 body designers of this project) didn't communicate too well and had the scaling wrong. I compared the scaling of my design to his and both the short and long sections were 20mm too short.

The reference screenshots we took from the movie did not show the proportions too well or had ban lighting, making it hard to view. This hindered my designing speed quite a bit as i needed to create good props from scratch for the parts. Since the scaling between both mine and generic villans were different i needed to change some parts my design to the right scaling.

Because of this i also needed to change the sizing of other pieces connecting onto this to help create a balance within the design, I figured it would look weird if everything was completely proportioned wrong. This managed to be a pain as i pretty much had to redesign my whole section to fit the scaling of his. Communication errors, how great!

I beilieve that the sizing should match up well for these two pieces to connect together well and hopefully correctly. To be hounest, a lot of the time spent on this section was deciding the sizing of every part since we didnt have set lenghs for every part. Re doing the whole thing really didnt help with time conservation.

To help get the designing part done, i decided to make a design sheet without the correct proportions (just to get my ideas somewhere first) before actually creating the propper designs with the correct scalings and proportions.

Similar to yesterday, my main focus is still on the bottom half of this project while the generic villain is working on the top area. Today, I worked on the legs of this robot as well as some add-ons for the left side of the robot. After a discussion with generic villain, we decided on most of the proportions of this project, which mostly included the proportions of already designed bits so that they would connect up well. In my opinion, this helped us overall combine our design, as now the proportions from the two designs match up. 

At the start of today, I started to work on the cupholder, which is meant to be put on the side of the robot. I first started with the top diameter of the semicircle at around 150mm. After I and generic villan started to compare design proportions and thinking about the sidebar, which I would design right after, we both thought that the cup holder was way too big, so the diameter of the circular area was shortened to 100mm. This also meant that the amount it was sticking out was shortened for proportional purposes, as usual. 

After this, I moved on to designing the sidebar, which is connected to the cup holder, also on the side of the robot, right behind it. When designing this, I had a slight misunderstanding with the design, thinking that the sidebar was sticking out farther than the cup holder, but after a quick look at a clip from the film, I realized my mistake. The side bar was meant to stick out around two-thirds as much as the cup holder did. This was a major time waster for me as I needed to redesign some bits of the sidebar because the proportion had been way off due to the change. I needed to cut the length, it was sticking out by half. 

After finishing the sidebar, I began to work on the legs, or more specifically, the smaller one first. the designing process for this was an absolute pain possibly even more so than the bigger leg, purely because of the amount of re dsigning i needed to do throughout this process. at first, i needed to come up with my measurements for the legs and getting measurements which would proportion properly to the rest of the body while not looking weird took longer than expected. 

At first, the design I made for the bottom of the small leg was a V shape with a longer edge on the front compared to the back. After this, I had moved onto the hands, which were mostly two rectangular prisms stacked onto each other, with two of these on a small surface. I had issues proportioning this to rectangles while still fitting well into the small surface area without being too thin, I ended up just making these squares (which I would soon change after completely redesigning this leg again). When designing plates to go onto these surfaces, just like in the main bottom area, I forgot about the fact that diagonals are longer than verticals, meaning I needed to redesign the plates. Another redesign because of sloppiness. 

after "finishing" this leg i looked at the refrence images as i was going to move onto the big leg then i realized how instead of the bottom of this leg being a v shape it was a diagonal connected to a bottom surface (similar to this: _/) meaning that i needed to redesign the bottom area. In this process, I also realized how off the lengths were compared to the rest of the body size, so I completely deleted the current progress and just restarted. I designed the legs to fit the one shown in the movie, and because of this, the overall size increased by about 15%. This helped with the hands mentioned earlier, as the wanted rectangular design wouldn't work well because of a lack of space. Now that the size has increased, meaning the surface area on which the hands are meant to be on increased, the rectangular design is now applicable. After this, I just needed to make simple changes to the surface plate's designs to finish up this leg. 

After finishing up the small leg, I moved on to designing the bigger one, which will prove to be just as painful and time-consuming to design. To start this leg, I began with the upper section before moving to the lower part. This area was annoying to make because the proportioning of it in the film was not very clear, and it was not shown too well in the film. Reference images also didn't prove too helpful with proportioning to the rest of the body, but did help me get the general shape of this bit. To be honest, the hardest part of the long leg was to find the proportions of the leg. After my first design of this leg, I found that some surfaces were too small compared to the other leg, so I needed to bump up the size by around 20% in some areas. I also found that the angles on certain areas were too subtle compared to the rest of the leg design, so I needed to start the angle off at six-eighths of the front leg length instead of my intended five-sixths. Because of the number of diagonals on this design, I needed to use a lot of double-to-triple decimal lines, which are more tedious to design with. This was especially apparent when making the plates for this leg as I had to constantly check the length of lines, which I found pretty tedious to do for every box.

During corespondence with Laij6, I realised that the notches on the top of my front-face were too small --- half the required size. I have spent a bit fixing that as well as designing the cover for the screen. Honestly, it was quite an average procces; no actual issues but it still took a while. 

**Time so far: 2hrs**

Today, compared to previous days had a lot less work which i needed to get done. for today's designing activites i just started off by double checking the parts which i already designinged. and yes for more pain of redesigning i realized when comparing the hands to refrence images that the vertical lengh for the base rectangle was too short. previously i designed it thinking that i would leave around 5 or 10 cm on both above and below the rectangle so i had designined the hands with this in mind. and now after looking at the refrence images frmo the movie, this included the pain of low PPI when zooming into frames (bad lighting in many scenes also didnt really help with this). i saw that instead of there being empty space above and below the hands that it simply took up the full space. because of this i redesigned the hands to fully take the up space provided vertically (50mm). this didnt change the proportioning too much so i left the width the same. while look at the refrence screenshot i used for the hand redesign, i also saw that there is a bar around the top of the big leg meaning that i had another component to design. this was a reasonably quick process as there wasnt too much work to do that was alocated to me for this day.

I spent a while trying to get the cupholder design of laij6 --- no no avail; I may add. I looked at the 100 most common food and beverages sold in the United States, which turned out to be the 100 most common food and beverages sold in the United States along with the 100 most common food and bevaages sold in the United States (the odd text in raw 3vs files), before finally figuring out how to download it. I discovered that there was, in fact, no peg on it (the thing I needed the dimensions for in order to design the hole on the side piece I have to make). I spent a couple seconds chiding my friend before getting on and adding it. I was editing laij6's side box when I realised I had not added the holes onto my own design for the front board. I proceeded to discover that I had underestimated the size of the screen and therefore had wasted at least an hour yesterday on designing the cover for the screen. I fixed this in a similar, boring fashion to the day before. Note: it is currently 2:58AM and so I shall be going to bed shortly. Expect further updates.

**Time so far: 3hrs**
