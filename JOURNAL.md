#June 5th, 2025 GenericVillain37: Today I began designing the main body for the robot. It is painful. I have a refrence image but the proportions are odd and we need to work out how the Pi and camera are going to fit in before I finish those holes.The sizing for the camera module took me a good few minutes but I think it works. I had the image up on my iPad so I could see it better.
