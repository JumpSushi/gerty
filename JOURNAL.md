Today I began designing the main body for the robot. It is painful. I have a refrence image but the proportions are odd and we need to work out how the Pi and camera are going to fit in before I finish those holes. The sizing for the camera module took me a good few minutes, but I think it works. I had the image up on my iPad so I could see it better.

Today i started working on the bottom bit of the robot, this is the area underneath the main body which generic villan is working on. After double checking the design about 20 minutes later i realized some of the pieces were not the correct sizing as the part is meant to go inwards and the pannel meant to go above it had only been designed to the height instead of the lengh of the surface.

I needed to re-do some of the sizing on pieces meant to be put onto diagonal surfaces since they were to short and would just leave open areas at the top or bottom. When designing the bottom area me and generic villain (the 2 body designers of this project) didnt communicate too well and had the scaling wrong. I compared the scaling of my design to his and both the short and long sections were 20mm too short.

The reference screen shots we took from the movie did not show the proportions too well or either had ban lighting making it hard to view. This hindered my designing speed quite a bit as i needed to create good proptions from scratch for the parts. Since the scaling between both mine and generic villans were differant i needed to change some parts my design to the right scaling.

Because of this i also needed to change the sizing of other pieces conneecting onto this to help create a balance within the design, I figured it would look weird if everything was completely proportioned wrong. This managed to be a pain as i pretty much had to redesign my whole section to fit the scaling of his. Communication errors, how great!

I beilieve that the sizing should match up well for these two pieces to connect together well and hopefully correctly. To be hounest, a lot of the time spent on this section was deciding the sizing of every part since we didnt have set lenghs for every part. Re doing the whole thing really didnt help with time conservation.

To help get the designing part done, i decided to make a design sheet without the correct proportions (just to get my ideas somewhere first) before actually creating the propper designs with the correct scalings and proportions.
